Its shape is minimalist yet dignified: a shallow basin with slightly upturned walls, complemented by a distinctive small ornamental lug or \"ear\" on the rim. The glaze exhibits quintessential Jun characteristics: a luscious layering of lavender-blue merging into deep crimson splashes, created through copper oxide under reduction firing.",
